# Pokedex-Helper

## Goal
- As a child playing Pokemon Showdown, I was terrible at knowing which type was best to play against a certain pokemon.
- This should help by allowing a user to enter a name of any pokemon and output lists of types that are good, ok, and bad to use against said pokemon.

## Class Structure
- Pokemon Class: has a given name and type of pokemon and has a method that obtains the lists of types to use against this specific Pokemon.
- Main Class: sets up all the Pokemon Objects for each pokemon from a spreadsheet, and has a scanner that reads user input and spits out output.
